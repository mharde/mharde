- 👋 Hi, I’m Maggie.
- 👀 I’m interested in creating documentation that eases users' anxieties about using products and services.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Git and Github. I'm also planning to refresh my knowledge on HTML, CSS, and Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects related to documentation, specifically in the gaming space.
- 📫 How to reach me? Discord or Twitter @MagzThaWriter.
