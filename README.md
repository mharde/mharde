- 👋 Hi, I’m Maggie (any pronouns).
- 👀 I’m interested in creating documentation that eases users' anxieties. I also want to learn how to code better!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Git and Github. I'm refreshing my knowledge on HTML, CSS, and Python with a dash of C++.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects related to documentation, game development tooling, and experimental entertainment.
- 📫 How to reach me? Discord, Twitter, BlueSky @MagzThaWriter.
